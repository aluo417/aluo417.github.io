> The most common use of Monte Carlo Simulation in finance is when one needs to calculate the expected value of a functional $$\mathbb{E} f(X)$$

## Introduction

Assume $$g(\cdot)$$ is the density function of random variable $$X$$. Then we can express the expectation as an integral:

\\[ \mathbb{E}f(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{f(t)g(t)dt} \\]

If this integral canâ€™t be computed explicitly, then Monte Carlo simulation techniques are adopted to estimate it. The idea is to use the Law of large Numbers (LLN) to estimate the integral.

Suppose $$\{X_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$$ is a sample of _i.i.d._ random variables with the same distribution as $$X$$ and $$\mathbb{E}(X)=\mu, Var(X)=\sigma^2 < \infty$$.

For the Sample Mean for random sample $$\{ f(X_1), f(X_2),...,f(X_n) \}$$ defined as 

\\[ \overline{fX_n} = \frac{f(X_1), f(X_2),...,f(X_n)}{n} \\]

we have
